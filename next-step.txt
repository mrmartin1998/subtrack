1. Editing Subscriptions
Ensure the subscription data is fetched and pre-filled correctly when editing.
Save the updates to the backend and reflect them in the dashboard.

2. Enhance the Dashboard
Add a loading spinner for a better user experience during data fetch.
Improve the UI to display empty states (e.g., "No subscriptions yet").

3. Profile Page
Allow users to view and update their profile (e.g., name, email, password).

4. Notifications
Implement notifications for upcoming subscription due dates.
Consider using setTimeout or backend-scheduled tasks for reminders.

5. Authentication Improvements
Add logout functionality to the app.
Auto-refresh the token when it expires or prompt the user to re-login.

6. Deployment
Prepare the app for deployment (e.g., to Vercel).
Set up MongoDB Atlas for production.
